--1. Corrected Answer (Semantic Error)
SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, employee, facility, eventplan
WHERE estaudience > 5000
AND eventplan.empno = employee.empno
AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno --missing join condition between eventrequest and eventplan
AND facname = 'Football stadium'
AND empname = 'Mary Manager';

--2. Corrected Answer (Redundancy Error) 
--Not needed group by clause used
SELECT DISTINCT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost

AND eventplan.eventno = eventrequest.eventno;

--Missing rows due to joins that are not required here
SELECT DISTINCT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, facility --, employee, facility, eventplan
WHERE estaudience > 5000
--AND eventplan.empno = employee.empno
AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
--AND eventplan.eventno = eventrequest.eventno
AND facname = 'Football stadium';

SELECT DISTINCT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, employee, eventplan
WHERE estaudience BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000
AND eventplan.empno = employee.empno
AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno
AND empname = 'Mary Manager';

--5. Corrected Answer for poor formatting (No Errors)
SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, resname, numberfld, timestart, timeend
FROM eventrequest, facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl
WHERE estaudience = '10000'
AND facname = 'Basketball arena'
